This repository supports the thesis work on the design, analysis, and prototyping of a low-cost, spring-based passive suspension system tailored for a heavy-duty Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR), targeting industrial and warehouse environments.

ðŸ“Œ Highlights:
	â€¢	Focus on static load scenarios and regular surfaces, with consideration for traction over obstacles.
	â€¢	Comparative review of robotic suspension technologies, identifying cost and complexity trade-offs.
	â€¢	Mechanical design driven by payload, DoF, and fatigue resistance requirements.
	â€¢	Concept selection via trade-off analysis leading to a passive spring system as the most viable solution.
	â€¢	Fully parametric CAD model to accommodate a wide range of spring configurations.
	â€¢	Python algorithm for spring selection and verification, allowing:
	â€¢	Custom input of design constraints
	â€¢	Automatic filtering and validation of springs
	â€¢	Integrated spring database based on Molle Industrialiâ€™s catalog for accurate real-world part selection.
	â€¢	Validation through analytical methods, FEM simulations, and physical prototyping.
